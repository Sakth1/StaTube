00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Would you risk burning alive
for half a million dollars?

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:04.071
Yes. Let's do it, man.

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:05.873
Ok, good luck man,
you're braver than me.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.508
This is gonna be crazy.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.811
This man is literally
in a burning building.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:12.412
There's fire around the door!

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.847
The entire room is on fire.

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:16.116
Oh my gosh, this is the craziest
thing we’ve ever filmed.

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.552
And behind him is $500,000,

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.688
which he could win
if he completes 7 fire traps,

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:24.191
including: getting shot out
of a cannon into fire,

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:26.593
jumps through death defying
rings of fire,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.130
survives massive fiery explosions,
and so much more.

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:31.698
- Get out of there!
- Get out of here. Come on.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.400
In case you're curious
who this gentleman is,

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:35.035
he's actually
a professional stunt man.

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:37.171
But we are gonna push him
to the max in this video.

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:39.006
He’s still gotta get the money
while the room's on fire.

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:40.007
Alright, watch out Chandler!

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.642
Alright, that's 2
of the 10 bags!

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:42.476
He’s on fire!

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:44.211
He's literally on fire!

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:46.013
Hey Nolan, get the fire extinguisher!

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.948
Hurry up!
The house is about to collapse!

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.249
Alright, that's it.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:51.852
The moneys on fire!
Oh my God, the money is burning.

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:53.754
Oh! You did it!

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.222
His legs are on fire.
Put it out!

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.990
Oh, my adrenaline is pumping
right now.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:00.093
You managed to get $250,000
out of that building.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.795
Let’s head
to the next death trap!

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:04.598
Take off your blindfold!

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:08.135
Eric, welcome to deathtrap #2.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.572
What is this, man?
How high up are we right now?

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:13.540
Uh, pretty high up.
Do you wanna look down?

00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:14.274
Not really.

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:16.410
Also, cue the fire.

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:20.781
Oh, come on, man.
What is this?

00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:22.783
I'm gonna be honest,
until we filmed this,

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.351
I didn't know you could
light water on fire.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.522
What's Jimmy's obsession with fire?

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:30.424
This death trap is very simple.

00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:33.827
Hanging in front of this platform are
3 bags of cash.

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:35.629
Each representing what could be

00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:37.798
the new amount of money
you'll be competing for.

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:39.399
And as they increase in amount,

00:01:40.234 --> 00:01:42.769
they get further and further
from the platform.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.374
You have to pick one of these 3 bags
to run and jump for.

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:49.977
If you hang on it,
that will be your new prize pool.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.779
Look how far away that is.
Oh my gosh.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.882
That is a solid distance
right there.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:55.649
Don't worry,
if you miss,

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:58.218
you'll just fall in a giant pond
of flaming water.

00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:01.288
I got shorter legs, but they'll
surprise you with some power.

00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:03.390
Ok. Which bag are we going for?

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:08.161
Do you want to take the easy route,
lower your prize pool by 100 grand?

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.763
Let's not do this one.
It's too easy, man.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.430
Alright.

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:13.600
Oh, man.

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:16.136
This is your current prize pool.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.138
Do you want the 250 grand,

00:02:18.205 --> 00:02:22.009
or do you wanna risk jumping 10 feet
for the 300 grand?

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:23.310
I'm gonna risk it all.

00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:24.011
Ok.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.482
Only the 300 grand remain, so…

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.050
Alright, here we are.

00:02:30.284 --> 00:02:31.685
And with that, oh--

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.088
Make sure you dodge the fire
and the scissors.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:35.656
Copy.

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:37.658
Is it really worth risking everything

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:39.793
just to add $50,000
to the prize pool?

00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:42.162
Now you're making me second guess
my decision making.

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:43.797
Here, can I see you jump?
Let's see it.

00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:44.665
Let's see, yeah.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.235
- You got the 300 grand!
- I appreciate that.

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:50.704
I don't think he got it.
That was nowhere near 10 feet.

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:54.808
$300,000 on the line.
100 million people watching.

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:57.244
Let's see if he does it.
Let's go!

00:02:57.444 --> 00:02:59.780
Three, two, one…

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:00.881
See ya.

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:02.583
Ah!

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.987
[Jimmy] Oh! Oh!

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:08.689
Wait, he's gotta
make it back, though.

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:12.025
- Hang on.
- Now he's gotta hold on.

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:13.760
- He did it! He did it!
- Yes!

00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:15.696
Yo!

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.898
$300,000.

00:03:17.965 --> 00:03:20.567
Let's see if he survives
the next 5 death traps.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.836
Oh… you got it.

00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:24.204
We’re just getting started.

00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:28.609
Eric might be a little too excited
about flying over a lake of fire.

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:31.712
So let's see how excited he is
about this next trap.

00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:33.247
Take off your blindfold.

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:37.150
Behind you is your $300,000 you won
in the last trap.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.286
What do you think trap #3 is?

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.288
Throwing me off a cliff
into some fire.

00:03:41.355 --> 00:03:42.890
Not that far off.

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:44.191
[laughing] Oh, great.

00:03:44.258 --> 00:03:45.559
Reveal the trap!

00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:49.062
Oh, Ok.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.497
For trap #3,

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:55.135
we are gonna be shooting you
out of this giant human sized cannon.

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:57.871
And if you land inside
of that yellow ring,

00:03:57.938 --> 00:04:00.974
you proceed with your $300,000
you've already won.

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:05.245
But, if you land
in that ring of fire,

00:04:05.312 --> 00:04:09.116
I will add another $50,000
to your prize pool.

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:10.117
I think it'll be awesome.

00:04:10.184 --> 00:04:12.653
I'm a stunt guy.
We're used to this kind of craziness.

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:16.757
But if you miss both rings,
you go home with nothing.

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:19.693
And you're probably wondering,
how do you calibrate the cannon?

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.429
How do you know if you're gonna go
too far or too short, left or right,

00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:23.797
slam into the concrete
over there?

00:04:24.698 --> 00:04:28.569
That is exactly what I am wondering
as I look at this monstrosity.

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:29.970
Bring in the stunt doubles!

00:04:30.037 --> 00:04:33.006
We'll be giving Eric 3 stunt doubles
to use as dummies.

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:34.908
One by one,
he will fire them off

00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:37.811
to dial in the pitch, power,
and direction of the cannon.

00:04:37.878 --> 00:04:40.681
If he doesn't hit the target
after all three stunt doubles,

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:42.916
his final shot will be
up to complete chance,

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:44.384
and he could lose
everything.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:48.856
If I can map the right distancing
into the 300k circle,

00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:51.191
and then make my way
into the fire and increase this,

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:52.659
I think that's my move.

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:54.995
Did you ever think in a million years
you'd be doing this right now?

00:04:55.062 --> 00:04:57.264
No, and now here we are doing it.

00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:59.633
This is your first
of 3 stunt doubles.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.871
You can either get him
one step closer to winning 350 grand,

00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:05.372
or one step further away.

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.007
What do you think
about the pitch angle?

00:05:07.074 --> 00:05:08.008
I'm gonna go up a little.

00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:10.911
So the higher he points it,
the further you go, just so you know.

00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:12.880
Ok, well let's ride.

00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:14.681
- Maybe a little higher?
- A little higher? Yeah, yeah.

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:15.983
A little higher? Ok.

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:18.819
Now for the last part of the equation
picture like a rubber band.

00:05:18.886 --> 00:05:20.187
The more you stretch it out,

00:05:20.254 --> 00:05:22.122
when you let go,
the further it flies.

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:24.925
So the further he pulls
your chair back,

00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:26.326
the further you're gonna go.

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:29.830
You're a tough dude. I'm feeling like
we should start you at 75%.

00:05:29.897 --> 00:05:31.598
Ok, so you want to do it right
in the middle.

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:33.200
Right in the middle. Yeah.

00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:34.234
Oh, boy.

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:35.235
Oh, no.

00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:37.037
Does it feel real
now that you're in it?

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:39.640
- A lot real. Really real.
- Oh, this is gonna be crazy.

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:42.643
Three, two, one…

00:05:43.043 --> 00:05:43.977
Fire!

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:45.712
[Jimmy] Oh.

00:05:46.313 --> 00:05:47.514
[Chandler] It’s good!

00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:48.815
[Nolan] Right in the middle!

00:05:49.216 --> 00:05:49.983
Ok.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.985
Bring in the second stunt double.

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.453
[Eric] Blue team.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.254
[Jimmy] There he is.

00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:56.423
Orange landed
in the middle of the yellow.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.892
He wants you to land
in the middle of the fire.

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:01.495
If I put you in the fire,
know I love ya.

00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:03.163
But it's all
in my best interest today.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.431
I'm gonna increase the power.

00:06:04.498 --> 00:06:06.033
Ok. Ok.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.168
And I'm going to bring this up
just a little bit.

00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:09.236
Alright, how do you feel
about that blue?

00:06:09.303 --> 00:06:12.306
[sighs] I think I'm gonna find out
very quickly.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:15.142
Based on my math,
Blue is gonna go a lot further.

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:16.210
Have a good ride, dude.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.779
Let's do it.
Pull the pin!

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:20.280
Oh! Oh!

00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:22.583
No good.
He missed.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:23.650
We are close.

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:26.887
He landed in between the yellow
circle and the ring of fire.

00:06:26.954 --> 00:06:28.655
Meaning if that was you,

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.024
the video would be over,
and you would have got nothing.

00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:31.959
Yeah.

00:06:32.192 --> 00:06:33.193
Come on in, Red.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.663
Ok, bro Eric,
this is your last stunt double.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.499
You gotta nail it right now
or you’re coin flipping it all.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:41.068
I'm gonna go up by 10,
leave the angle.

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:42.736
And we'll see what that gets us.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.371
Arm the cannon!

00:06:44.438 --> 00:06:46.540
- You better land in that fire!
- You better get it dude!

00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:49.943
Three, two, one…

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.144
Fire!

00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:52.379
Oh, wait.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.882
It's good, he did it!

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:56.717
He barely made it in.

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:59.286
I'm gonna increase the power by 5.

00:06:59.353 --> 00:07:01.755
And I think it's gonna get me
into my sweet spot.

00:07:01.822 --> 00:07:05.526
But first, why are you trying so hard
to land in the fire,

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:08.428
and add an extra $50,000
to your prize pool?

00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:11.365
My dad's health has been up
and down roller coaster

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.267
from some cancer to health stuff.

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:14.401
This is something that

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:17.371
I can use to really invest into
giving them a good retirement

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.306
and helping with their health
and continued growth.

00:07:19.373 --> 00:07:21.441
That's why you want
to keep growing the prize pool,

00:07:21.508 --> 00:07:24.211
and you wanna land in the fire and
you wanna keep taking all these risks

00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:26.046
so you can take care
of your parents.

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:27.347
It's a pretty special thing, so.

00:07:27.414 --> 00:07:30.217
I agree. I'd do the same for my mom,
it's freaking awesome.

00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:31.785
Let's see if he lands
in the fire.

00:07:31.852 --> 00:07:35.489
You have $300,000 riding
on this shot.

00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:37.558
Well, I'm taking care of my parents.

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:39.927
I gotta do everything I can
to support 'em, so…

00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:40.894
We gotta go big.

00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:43.630
Three, two, one…

00:07:43.864 --> 00:07:44.831
Fire!

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:47.467
300 grand on the line.

00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:52.840
- [Jimmy] He did it!
- [Nolan] He did it! Yes, yes!

00:07:52.906 --> 00:07:54.942
- Oh my gosh.
- We gotta give it to him.

00:07:55.008 --> 00:07:59.546
He did it, he's moving on
to the next trap with $350,000.

00:07:59.613 --> 00:08:00.981
Come on over!

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:01.915
Let's go, Eric!

00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:04.518
$350,000!

00:08:04.585 --> 00:08:06.820
But, but…
I need to bag you.

00:08:07.287 --> 00:08:07.921
Wait. What?

00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:09.256
Don't ask questions.

00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:13.227
He still has 4 death traps between
him and his 350 grand.

00:08:13.293 --> 00:08:14.661
Let's go to the next one.

00:08:16.964 --> 00:08:20.567
Eric, welcome to death trap #4.

00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:24.938
Behind you is your $350,000…

00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:28.609
in a giant room full of fireworks.

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.744
And above that room is a meteor.

00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:33.514
What do you think
we're about to do?

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.149
Blow up this money if I don't get
something accomplished here

00:08:36.216 --> 00:08:37.084
in a fast amount of time.

00:08:37.484 --> 00:08:39.253
- Correct, basically.
- Yeah.

00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:42.489
You will have exactly 5 minutes
to throw this grappling hook,

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.893
and drag as many bags of money
as you can

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:48.495
back up onto the bed
of this truck.

00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:50.931
When that 5 minute timer hits zero,

00:08:51.765 --> 00:08:54.301
that meteor, which will be on fire,

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:57.871
is gonna crash into this room full
of fireworks with your money.

00:08:57.938 --> 00:09:01.975
And whatever's not on this truck when
that timer hits zero will explode.

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:04.711
Oh, Ok.
I've never thrown a grappling hook.

00:09:05.846 --> 00:09:07.314
This is gonna be interesting.

00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:08.649
And before we start,

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:13.187
we're gonna give you an opportunity
to potentially win an extra $50,000.

00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:16.857
That is $400,000 in cash
sitting in those bags.

00:09:16.924 --> 00:09:17.891
I came here with nothing,

00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.493
leaving with anything
would be amazing.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.029
So if I get one bag on this truck,
I will be stoked.

00:09:22.095 --> 00:09:23.931
I would feel really bad
if you only got one bag.

00:09:23.997 --> 00:09:25.299
Well, I'm going for all of them.

00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:27.167
The amazing things I could do
for my parents

00:09:27.234 --> 00:09:28.869
and taking care of them
into their old age.

00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:30.070
Aw, I’m rooting for you!

00:09:30.137 --> 00:09:30.938
I knew it!

00:09:31.004 --> 00:09:32.573
And just so we're
on the same page,

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:36.643
I don't control that meteor,
and those are real fireworks.

00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:38.245
When that timer hit zero,

00:09:38.312 --> 00:09:42.850
we literally need to be behind these
blast shields or we could, like, die.

00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:44.818
I don't want
to die here today,

00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:45.586
You know what?
Same page.

00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:47.087
Come on, man.
We're on the same page.

00:09:47.521 --> 00:09:49.556
$400,000 on the line.

00:09:49.623 --> 00:09:51.058
Yell, "Light the meteor."

00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:52.125
Uh, light the meteor?

00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:53.093
Yell it.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.394
LIGHT THE METEOR!

00:09:54.895 --> 00:09:55.629
Oh!

00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:00.968
Three, two, one…

00:10:01.034 --> 00:10:02.269
Start the timer!

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:05.138
First throw.

00:10:07.274 --> 00:10:08.308
Alright, he got a bag!

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:09.676
- He got a bag on his first throw!
- We got one!

00:10:09.743 --> 00:10:11.778
We got first fish on the line, baby!

00:10:11.845 --> 00:10:13.714
Yeah, nah, these things are heavy.
He's gotta pull it up--

00:10:14.014 --> 00:10:15.048
[grunting] Come on.

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:15.749
Step it up.

00:10:15.816 --> 00:10:16.583
Here we go.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.486
Oh, look at that meteor up there!
That is crazy.

00:10:21.588 --> 00:10:22.122
Watch out!

00:10:22.189 --> 00:10:23.390
No, don't do that--

00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:25.192
I might’ve messed him up.

00:10:25.259 --> 00:10:26.193
We got one, baby!

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.096
Thirty seconds have gone by.
You got this.

00:10:29.162 --> 00:10:29.897
Come on.

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.398
Wow, that meteor is burning.

00:10:31.465 --> 00:10:33.333
Come on, don't worry
about the meteor!

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.268
The fire's dripping.

00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:36.303
It might light on fire
before 5 minutes.

00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:37.938
Come on, we got one!

00:10:38.005 --> 00:10:38.939
Alright, #3!

00:10:41.308 --> 00:10:43.310
Guys, those are real fireworks.
They're not a prop.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.246
And when that meteor falls,
the explosion’s gonna be insane.

00:10:46.313 --> 00:10:47.114
I'm kinda scared.

00:10:49.049 --> 00:10:49.950
Come on, baby…

00:10:52.686 --> 00:10:55.422
Eric, let's go!
In 3 minutes, I can--

00:10:55.522 --> 00:10:56.924
Oh, he's missing!

00:10:57.424 --> 00:10:58.825
When the timer hits zero,

00:10:58.892 --> 00:11:01.128
this truck is moving
'cause if not,

00:11:01.195 --> 00:11:03.764
we can literally get hit
with, like, a thousand fireworks.

00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:05.165
We got it!

00:11:05.232 --> 00:11:07.334
This will put him at $200,000.

00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:08.869
200! Come on.
Help me out, there.

00:11:08.936 --> 00:11:12.172
So, half the time's gone by,
and he's got half the money. But now…

00:11:12.973 --> 00:11:14.374
- Come on!
- He keeps missing.

00:11:14.441 --> 00:11:15.042
[grunts]

00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:16.176
Oh, it's stuck!

00:11:16.243 --> 00:11:17.411
- It's stuck!
- Next hook.

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:20.781
Wait. Alright, I had a feeling
that would happen. You have 2 left!

00:11:20.848 --> 00:11:23.116
- Thank you.
- Oh my gosh, you're wasting time!

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:24.918
At this pace, he's not gonna get
all the money.

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:26.753
- Don't talk like that, Jimmy.
- Go, go!

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:27.788
Don’t talk like that.

00:11:30.624 --> 00:11:33.360
Oh my gosh!
Oh, Eric!

00:11:33.427 --> 00:11:35.896
Oh no, Eric.
I don't want it to happen like this--

00:11:35.963 --> 00:11:36.396
I know!

00:11:36.463 --> 00:11:37.831
He is not getting the bags
quick enough.

00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:38.665
He's gotta speed up.

00:11:41.768 --> 00:11:43.136
Ugh, I stepped on the line.

00:11:43.604 --> 00:11:44.905
His foot was on the line.

00:11:46.273 --> 00:11:46.940
Alright, he got one.

00:11:47.007 --> 00:11:49.910
Less than 2 minutes and
those fireworks are gonna blow up.

00:11:50.711 --> 00:11:52.946
Make sure you're behind
the glass wall, camera guy.

00:11:53.013 --> 00:11:53.847
Help me out, Jimmy.
Come on.

00:11:53.914 --> 00:11:55.048
Alright. 90 seconds.

00:12:02.356 --> 00:12:03.957
- You lost another one?
- Lost another one.

00:12:04.024 --> 00:12:06.426
Oh my gosh, there’s $150,000
still over there,

00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:08.128
and just over a minute left!

00:12:08.195 --> 00:12:10.330
Come on, man.
Let's not leave this money behind.

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:12.165
I’m gonna try and help you out.
Let’s go!

00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:16.970
It bounced off the wood that’s laying
on the bag!

00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:19.907
- Come on.
- Oh, no! I missed it.

00:12:19.973 --> 00:12:21.208
- Come on, Jimmy.
- Why is this so hard?

00:12:21.275 --> 00:12:22.276
We got this, buddy.

00:12:22.342 --> 00:12:24.478
In less than 30 seconds, we gotta get
behind that blast shield!

00:12:24.545 --> 00:12:26.280
I'm not joking,
that meteor’s falling--

00:12:26.346 --> 00:12:28.315
We got one!
Last one, I think.

00:12:28.549 --> 00:12:29.516
Hurry up!

00:12:29.716 --> 00:12:31.051
You gotta go!

00:12:31.118 --> 00:12:32.019
Come on!

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:33.854
Alright, 14 seconds--
13 seconds.

00:12:33.921 --> 00:12:34.721
We’re good.

00:12:34.788 --> 00:12:36.490
Oh, that meteor’s falling
in 10 seconds!

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.558
We gotta go, Jimmy!

00:12:37.624 --> 00:12:40.160
It burned the power cables!
Oh, yeah. Hey, leave it behind!

00:12:40.227 --> 00:12:41.461
Go, go, go!

00:12:41.528 --> 00:12:42.496
Get in here.

00:12:42.563 --> 00:12:43.597
Close the door.

00:12:45.132 --> 00:12:46.300
Come on, let’s do this.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.634
Woo!

00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:50.871
- Holy cow!
- Oh my God!

00:12:50.938 --> 00:12:51.805
Woo!

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:04.251
It's safe to say
that 100 grand is gone.

00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:06.687
But he still has more opportunities
to win money.

00:13:06.753 --> 00:13:08.155
Let's go to the next trap.

00:13:08.222 --> 00:13:08.989
Let's go!

00:13:09.056 --> 00:13:12.659
In honor of the $100,000
that just exploded in a ball of fire,

00:13:12.726 --> 00:13:14.862
we thought we'd go somewhere special…

00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:17.998
Eric, welcome back
to where it all started.

00:13:18.065 --> 00:13:22.736
This is the room at the start
of the video where you lost $250,000.

00:13:24.605 --> 00:13:25.939
What are we doing
back in this room, man?

00:13:26.006 --> 00:13:26.773
I hate this room.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.141
Light the room on fire!

00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:29.276
Come on, man!

00:13:29.343 --> 00:13:31.111
The room is now lit on fire,

00:13:31.178 --> 00:13:35.048
and if you do not get this money out
before it burns, you will lose it.

00:13:35.549 --> 00:13:37.651
But I will cut you out

00:13:37.718 --> 00:13:41.855
if you tell me you like my brand-new
Jack Link’s MrBeast beef stick.

00:13:43.724 --> 00:13:44.625
Let's go.
I'm in.

00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:46.827
This is my brand new product
with Jack Link’s.

00:13:46.894 --> 00:13:47.728
What do you think of it?

00:13:47.794 --> 00:13:48.896
It's actually really good, man.

00:13:48.962 --> 00:13:49.663
Try some more.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.165
- That fire’s getting kinda big.
- I know. Let’s go, come on!

00:13:52.232 --> 00:13:53.333
This is our original flavor.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.501
That's actually really good, too.

00:13:54.568 --> 00:13:55.469
Ok, but be honest,

00:13:55.536 --> 00:13:58.539
are you saying our brand-new MrBeast
Jack Link's beef sticks

00:13:58.605 --> 00:14:01.842
made with 100% real beef are good
because you want me to cut you out?

00:14:01.909 --> 00:14:02.843
It’s actually really good--

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.411
I'm not sure I'm convinced.

00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:05.746
[unintelligible] It's great!

00:14:05.812 --> 00:14:06.446
I'll cut you free.

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:07.881
Oh wait, actually,
one more thing.

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:09.683
What do you think of the packaging?

00:14:10.017 --> 00:14:11.952
It's awesome, dude.
The coloring’s amazing.

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:13.253
It's actually getting kinda hot
in here.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.354
Alright, you're free.

00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:15.923
- Let’s get the money out of here!
- Get the money.

00:14:16.256 --> 00:14:17.457
While y’all are doing that…

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:18.659
We’re outta here, come on!

00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:20.160
- Hey! The beef stick!
- Get the beef stick.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:23.964
You're gonna die.

00:14:24.031 --> 00:14:25.165
- Come on.
- Ok.

00:14:25.232 --> 00:14:29.203
You just survived another death trap
with $300,000 in cash.

00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:30.671
- Everyone, cheers.
- Woo!

00:14:30.737 --> 00:14:33.173
Let's celebrate.
You can try it. We have 4 flavors.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.808
Each beef stick has 5 grams
of protein.

00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:36.109
You can buy it
at these retailers.

00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:38.011
And guys, this trap was easier.

00:14:38.078 --> 00:14:40.581
But the next one, you're probably
gonna lose a lot of money.

00:14:40.647 --> 00:14:42.950
Come on, man, wait a second.
Talk to me here.

00:14:43.016 --> 00:14:44.117
I need more beef sticks.

00:14:45.252 --> 00:14:47.321
I hope Eric enjoyed all that protein,

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:50.490
because he's going to
need his strength for this next trap.

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:54.761
Welcome to trap #6!
What do you think of this, Eric?

00:14:54.828 --> 00:14:57.064
Aw, man. It’s always fire!

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:01.368
Not only did we bring back fire,
but we also brought the person

00:15:01.435 --> 00:15:03.437
that when I asked you
before this challenge,

00:15:03.504 --> 00:15:05.205
you said you would trust
your life with…

00:15:05.272 --> 00:15:07.274
you said you would trust
your bank account with…

00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:09.309
every dollar
to your name with…

00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:10.911
your best friend,
Pat.

00:15:10.978 --> 00:15:13.213
Dude! What's up, brother?

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.581
I hope you're ready for this, buddy.

00:15:14.648 --> 00:15:16.750
You and your best friend, Pat,

00:15:16.817 --> 00:15:19.186
will be doing this death trap
together.

00:15:19.253 --> 00:15:21.688
I'll explain more
once I teleport to the top.

00:15:22.689 --> 00:15:23.957
Alrighty, here we go, Pat.

00:15:24.024 --> 00:15:27.895
For death trap #6,
Eric and his best friend

00:15:27.961 --> 00:15:29.763
are gonna be chained together.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.298
Bring it out, boys.

00:15:31.732 --> 00:15:33.066
There's always a catch.

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:34.468
That's pretty short.

00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:36.637
It is… not ideal.

00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:39.973
Eric is going to be chained
to his best friend.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.310
While chained, Eric and Pat
will have to move together

00:15:43.377 --> 00:15:46.980
to scale this 50-foot tower
and collect all 6 bags of money.

00:15:47.047 --> 00:15:48.348
And at the top of the tower,

00:15:48.415 --> 00:15:52.152
I have left an extra 50 grand
that you can add to your prize pool.

00:15:52.219 --> 00:15:57.090
Whatever bags are not grabbed will be
dropped and incinerated immediately.

00:15:57.157 --> 00:16:00.561
And one more thing:
if either of you fall at any point,

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:03.897
the video's over
and you lose everything, Eric.

00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:05.799
Any last words for each other?

00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:08.202
I love you, bro.
And I trust you, man. Let's get this.

00:16:08.268 --> 00:16:09.203
Another adventure.

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:10.637
Man, let's have a good time, bro.

00:16:10.704 --> 00:16:12.072
Tareq, why aren’t we close like that?

00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:13.340
You wanna be chained up?

00:16:13.407 --> 00:16:14.107
No.

00:16:14.174 --> 00:16:14.908
That’s fair.

00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:18.212
Three, two, one…

00:16:18.512 --> 00:16:19.847
Go!

00:16:19.947 --> 00:16:21.248
Alright, they are off.

00:16:21.315 --> 00:16:23.517
Slow and easy, Eric.
Slow and easy.

00:16:23.584 --> 00:16:24.251
Come on, Pat.

00:16:25.185 --> 00:16:26.053
Platform's moving.

00:16:26.119 --> 00:16:27.387
They got the first 50 grand.

00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:28.755
Aw, perfect, dude!

00:16:28.856 --> 00:16:30.557
[Pat] Ok, Eric, we got this.

00:16:32.192 --> 00:16:34.294
Slow and easy, Eric.
Slow and easy.

00:16:34.361 --> 00:16:35.295
Alright they have 2 bags.

00:16:35.362 --> 00:16:38.065
Ok, once you’re on level with me,
I'm gonna move across there.

00:16:38.131 --> 00:16:41.034
If just a single bag falls
in the fire, it's gone.

00:16:42.202 --> 00:16:44.271
- Move in quick. Go to carry.
- I’m level, go.

00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:44.972
Go.

00:16:45.038 --> 00:16:46.406
Oh, these guys are crushing it.

00:16:46.473 --> 00:16:48.175
Slow. Bring it over,
nice and easy.

00:16:50.444 --> 00:16:51.945
- Oh, gosh. You're going too fast.
- Hold on!

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:53.213
- I still have the bag in my hand.
- Let me get my footing.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.581
Slow it down just a little bit.

00:16:54.648 --> 00:16:57.684
Don't fall!
If you fall, it's over!

00:16:57.751 --> 00:16:58.285
Alright.

00:16:58.352 --> 00:16:59.152
Ok.

00:16:59.219 --> 00:17:00.554
Alright.
Can you come to me some?

00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:02.489
Come on, baby.

00:17:02.556 --> 00:17:03.857
Dang, they've already got 3 bags.

00:17:05.993 --> 00:17:07.494
It's moving quick.

00:17:07.561 --> 00:17:09.062
Coming.
Nice and easy.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:10.597
It’s moving quick.

00:17:10.664 --> 00:17:11.532
Come on, baby.

00:17:11.598 --> 00:17:12.966
Ok. Coming across.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.034
Go ahead.

00:17:14.101 --> 00:17:15.469
Little bit more space.
A little bit more.

00:17:15.802 --> 00:17:16.503
Got it?

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:18.805
Gosh, these are not easy
to get off that hook.

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:19.973
- Moving.
- Ok!

00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:21.208
Come on.

00:17:21.575 --> 00:17:22.109
Ok.

00:17:22.176 --> 00:17:23.210
We're doin’ good.
Come on, baby.

00:17:23.277 --> 00:17:24.878
- Got it. Boom.
- Keep it up.

00:17:24.945 --> 00:17:25.913
Give me some slack, buddy.

00:17:26.113 --> 00:17:28.015
Go for it, Eric.
Let me know if you have space.

00:17:28.949 --> 00:17:29.983
Smooth and focused.

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:35.222
This is his final bag.
His extra 50 grand.

00:17:35.289 --> 00:17:36.323
Thing’s are getting wide up here.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:37.591
Alright, I see that.

00:17:37.658 --> 00:17:38.959
This is it. The last one.

00:17:39.026 --> 00:17:42.095
Alright. Nice and easy, Eric.
Don't mess this up right now.

00:17:42.162 --> 00:17:42.763
[grunting]

00:17:42.829 --> 00:17:43.697
Don't fall.

00:17:43.764 --> 00:17:44.765
I'm not gonna fall!

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:54.408
Get that on there.Yes!

00:17:54.474 --> 00:17:58.579
They have now secured the money,
but they still have to climb up top.

00:17:58.645 --> 00:17:59.680
Oh, dude, he's going!

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.614
Come on.

00:18:00.681 --> 00:18:01.782
Here we go.

00:18:02.115 --> 00:18:03.116
Last little one.

00:18:04.518 --> 00:18:05.319
[grunting]

00:18:05.385 --> 00:18:07.187
Oh my God, he made it!
He made it!

00:18:07.254 --> 00:18:08.155
Woo!

00:18:08.355 --> 00:18:08.956
Yeah!

00:18:09.022 --> 00:18:10.490
You’re my bro, dude!

00:18:11.458 --> 00:18:12.693
Over the platform.

00:18:12.993 --> 00:18:15.429
We did it, dude.
You're my man.

00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:18.365
The hardest trap of this entire video

00:18:18.432 --> 00:18:21.768
is all that stands between you
and $350,000.

00:18:21.835 --> 00:18:26.340
Ok, take off the blindfold.
Welcome to your final trap.

00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:28.475
Woo! Alright.

00:18:28.542 --> 00:18:30.677
One more elaborate
than the last.

00:18:30.744 --> 00:18:34.047
This death trap is more like
an obstacle course,

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:37.017
where there are 5 different stages
that you will have to complete

00:18:37.084 --> 00:18:39.253
in under a minute and 5 seconds.

00:18:39.319 --> 00:18:40.988
Why is it a minute and 5 seconds?

00:18:41.054 --> 00:18:43.657
That's because we had 4 stunt men
attempt this course,

00:18:43.724 --> 00:18:47.060
and the average of their time was
1 minute and 5 seconds.

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:48.262
The obstacle course will begin

00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:50.163
with you being shot out
of the cannon again,

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.499
and then jump
through multiple rings of fire.

00:18:52.566 --> 00:18:54.701
After that, you will have to
dodge swinging hammers,

00:18:54.768 --> 00:18:56.537
swim underneath fire,

00:18:56.603 --> 00:18:59.973
and lastly, run across
this massive fire hallway,

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.810
then jump and grab your money
before it falls and burns.

00:19:03.877 --> 00:19:06.513
And this time,
there's no way to get it back.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.215
Woo, here we go.
No pressure, right?

00:19:09.116 --> 00:19:11.919
Alright, Eric, take a seat
inside your cannon.

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:13.921
It's time for the finale.

00:19:15.923 --> 00:19:19.259
Eric, this might be the most
important moment of your life.

00:19:19.326 --> 00:19:20.127
Are you ready?

00:19:20.194 --> 00:19:22.763
Jimmy, I got a lot of hesitations
on this one, man,

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:26.300
but, all my time as a stuntman
has prepared me for this moment.

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:28.836
You will have a minute and 5 seconds

00:19:28.902 --> 00:19:32.206
to make it across
this entire flaming obstacle course

00:19:32.272 --> 00:19:34.374
and grab your money
before it burns.

00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:35.542
Do you have any questions?

00:19:35.609 --> 00:19:38.312
Anything you wanna know
before I fire you out of a cannon

00:19:38.378 --> 00:19:40.047
and start that timer?

00:19:40.113 --> 00:19:42.049
What are the odds you give me
a little more time, man?

00:19:42.115 --> 00:19:43.984
I got some doubts in here, buddy.

00:19:44.051 --> 00:19:45.886
What, you want more
than a minute and 5 seconds?

00:19:45.953 --> 00:19:48.222
I mean, if you're willing to give it
to me, I’d take it.

00:19:48.288 --> 00:19:50.524
Yeah. I can't do that.
Any other questions?

00:19:50.591 --> 00:19:52.192
No. That was the only one, buddy.

00:19:52.259 --> 00:19:54.494
Whenever you're ready, let's do this.

00:19:54.561 --> 00:19:55.829
Alright, here we go.

00:19:55.896 --> 00:19:56.430
Three…

00:19:58.599 --> 00:19:59.099
Two…

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:01.802
One…

00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:02.669
Fire him!

00:20:04.705 --> 00:20:06.273
And the timer is up!

00:20:06.507 --> 00:20:08.842
Ok. He has a minute
and 2 seconds left

00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:10.077
and it’s literally dwindling down.

00:20:10.143 --> 00:20:13.480
If he doesn't swim faster,
his money will burn.

00:20:14.314 --> 00:20:15.549
The timer’s paused.

00:20:15.616 --> 00:20:18.652
So, scattered throughout the course
are these safe zones.

00:20:18.719 --> 00:20:20.053
He's on the first safe zone,

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.489
when he gets on a safe zone,
the timer pauses.

00:20:22.556 --> 00:20:24.591
So, you have 55 seconds left.

00:20:24.658 --> 00:20:25.492
How we doin’?

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:28.629
Agh, gathering my breath.
I got a mouth full of water,

00:20:28.695 --> 00:20:30.130
but I'm feelin’ good right now!

00:20:30.197 --> 00:20:31.798
I lost 10 seconds,

00:20:31.865 --> 00:20:33.867
but I think I can make up
some time here Jimmy.

00:20:33.934 --> 00:20:35.769
Have you ever jumped
through a ring of fire?

00:20:35.836 --> 00:20:37.304
I have not jumped
through a ring of fire.

00:20:37.371 --> 00:20:40.374
I’ve been into a house on fire,
this is a first man.

00:20:40.474 --> 00:20:42.309
Hey, first time for everything,
you got this!

00:20:42.376 --> 00:20:45.779
Next up, you have 3 flaming rings.
Seems pretty simple, right?

00:20:46.013 --> 00:20:48.882
Hey, it's a fierce symbol,
but I put nothin’ past you, man.

00:20:48.949 --> 00:20:50.851
Nothin’ ever is as easy
as it seems.

00:20:50.918 --> 00:20:52.953
The big thing is,
the gaps behind the rings.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.688
If you fall and have to
pull yourself up,

00:20:54.755 --> 00:20:56.323
that will eat up a lot of time.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.525
Nice clean jumps straight through.

00:20:58.592 --> 00:20:59.493
Here we go!

00:21:00.194 --> 00:21:02.462
Alright, it’s on!
The timer has started again.

00:21:02.529 --> 00:21:03.297
First ring.

00:21:03.363 --> 00:21:04.531
Oh! He's goin’.
He's good.

00:21:04.598 --> 00:21:06.300
- Oh, you fell!
- Oh, he fell in the water?

00:21:06.366 --> 00:21:08.268
You're supposed to go
through the ring not under it!

00:21:08.335 --> 00:21:10.370
That's what I was worried about!
He's wasting time!

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:11.538
Eric! Let's go!

00:21:11.605 --> 00:21:13.607
Get through the third ring!
Get on the safe zone!

00:21:13.674 --> 00:21:15.309
On the safe zone!
Pause! Alright.

00:21:15.375 --> 00:21:17.411
Aww! [grunts]

00:21:17.477 --> 00:21:18.912
42 seconds remain!

00:21:19.179 --> 00:21:22.216
I lost a little time there!
Stubbed my toe, that's alright!

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:24.318
You have 3 stages left
in the course.

00:21:24.384 --> 00:21:28.689
If you finish in the next 42 seconds,
what will that money do for you?

00:21:28.755 --> 00:21:30.490
It's gonna change my life, man!

00:21:30.557 --> 00:21:32.226
I'm gonna be doin’ a lot
for my parents.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:34.928
I’m mappin’ their health,
I‘m mappin’ their retirement.

00:21:34.995 --> 00:21:38.298
They are my sole focus,
and they're why I'm doing this, man.

00:21:38.365 --> 00:21:41.368
Oh my gosh, man,
I really hope Eric wins.

00:21:42.035 --> 00:21:44.938
The course gets harder as he goes,
so… let's see.

00:21:45.105 --> 00:21:46.139
You got this man!

00:21:46.206 --> 00:21:46.874
Thank you, boys!

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.609
Lock in you got this,
that’s why we're here.

00:21:48.675 --> 00:21:49.643
Whenever you're ready.

00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:51.178
Alright.

00:21:53.647 --> 00:21:54.448
He's off.

00:21:54.515 --> 00:21:55.916
Ok, so these platforms move.

00:21:55.983 --> 00:21:56.750
Don't fall!

00:21:56.817 --> 00:21:58.752
That's what makes it tricky,
it looks easy,

00:21:58.819 --> 00:22:01.588
but the platforms are floating
on water, not anchored down.

00:22:01.655 --> 00:22:03.423
- He got through! Next safe zone!
- Woo!

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:03.924
Ok!

00:22:03.991 --> 00:22:07.794
34 seconds remain,
but I'm not sure that it'll be enough.

00:22:07.861 --> 00:22:08.328
Oh, man.

00:22:08.395 --> 00:22:10.664
This next part eats up a lotta time.

00:22:10.731 --> 00:22:13.400
Obviously, you can't swim
through the fire.

00:22:13.767 --> 00:22:14.935
That would kill you.

00:22:15.135 --> 00:22:17.871
So, for this next part of the course…

00:22:19.106 --> 00:22:21.375
you have to swim under the fire.

00:22:22.442 --> 00:22:26.346
I wish I was a stronger swimmer,
and I wish I had my breath,

00:22:26.413 --> 00:22:27.648
but I'm gonna get this done, man.

00:22:27.714 --> 00:22:30.384
If you look to your right,
you'll see a pair of goggles.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:31.818
You might want to throw those on

00:22:31.885 --> 00:22:34.054
because you're about to swim
under flames.

00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:37.891
The amount of time Eric has left
may seem like a lot,

00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:41.161
but the distance he has to swim
is pretty far.

00:22:41.228 --> 00:22:44.798
And if he has to come up for air,
it'll really set him back.

00:22:44.865 --> 00:22:46.500
34 seconds remain!

00:22:46.567 --> 00:22:50.504
Between your $350,000 being
in your bank account,

00:22:50.571 --> 00:22:52.739
or being in that furnace
over there.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.808
That's on you, man.

00:22:55.576 --> 00:22:56.577
Here we go.

00:23:04.318 --> 00:23:07.187
Oh he's off!
Please do not get out in the fire.

00:23:07.254 --> 00:23:09.022
He only has 30 seconds left!

00:23:09.089 --> 00:23:10.757
- Where is he?
- I don't see him.

00:23:10.824 --> 00:23:11.725
Where is he?

00:23:11.992 --> 00:23:12.893
Oh, he's there!

00:23:13.293 --> 00:23:15.696
Get up, get up!

00:23:15.762 --> 00:23:17.497
Alright it doesn't stop
till he’s up here!

00:23:17.564 --> 00:23:18.866
Come up! Come up!

00:23:18.932 --> 00:23:21.168
Grab the rope! Yes! Alright.
Stop, stop! Alright.

00:23:21.235 --> 00:23:22.769
[Eric] Ooh ooh, ooh.

00:23:24.304 --> 00:23:25.806
17 seconds remain!

00:23:25.873 --> 00:23:26.573
Woo!

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.776
Ok. It's not a lot of time
for the final course.

00:23:29.877 --> 00:23:31.078
There’s not a lotta time!

00:23:31.144 --> 00:23:33.413
But I got short legs,
and they're made for sprinting, man.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.982
Here, catch your breath.

00:23:35.048 --> 00:23:36.884
He’s talking
while he’s full of water.

00:23:37.284 --> 00:23:38.519
For this final challenge,

00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:40.254
we need you to put on
this fireproof suit

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.090
because you will literally be running
through fire.

00:23:43.156 --> 00:23:45.459
This whole time,
I've been dodging fire left and right

00:23:45.526 --> 00:23:46.927
and now I'm running head on
into it?

00:23:46.994 --> 00:23:47.661
Oh, yeah.

00:23:47.728 --> 00:23:48.962
And it's gonna be
all around me?

00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:50.898
Yeah. No, you will literally be
running through fire.

00:23:50.964 --> 00:23:53.066
You escaped a room on fire…

00:23:53.133 --> 00:23:57.638
you were launched out of a cannon,
you survived a massive fireball…

00:23:57.704 --> 00:23:59.840
And now you'll have to run
through the hall of flames

00:23:59.907 --> 00:24:02.009
and grab your money
to win it all.

00:24:02.075 --> 00:24:03.710
How is he supposed to run
through that?

00:24:03.777 --> 00:24:05.179
- Good luck.
- Do this man!

00:24:05.245 --> 00:24:06.213
This guy's a freak!

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:06.914
Woo!

00:24:07.514 --> 00:24:10.250
This suit will fend off the fire
for a bit.

00:24:10.317 --> 00:24:12.019
You might as well put it on.

00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:14.254
And finally, here's your gloves.

00:24:14.321 --> 00:24:16.290
See your $350,000?

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:17.357
I see it, man.

00:24:17.424 --> 00:24:20.093
Once you leave the safe zone,
you’ll have 17 seconds

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:24.398
to literally run through what I call
the hall of flames

00:24:24.464 --> 00:24:25.966
and grab your money.

00:24:26.366 --> 00:24:27.768
It's another house fire.

00:24:28.836 --> 00:24:31.271
The timer starts back up
when he gets off the green pad.

00:24:31.338 --> 00:24:32.339
I gotta admit,

00:24:32.406 --> 00:24:35.475
this guy has been pretty fearless
this entire time.

00:24:35.542 --> 00:24:39.646
But I can tell that right now,
for the first time in this video,

00:24:39.713 --> 00:24:42.516
he was actually scared
of losing his money.

00:24:42.583 --> 00:24:44.484
Not much time left.
Will he make it?

00:24:44.551 --> 00:24:47.287
In three, two, one…

00:24:47.621 --> 00:24:48.455
See ya.

00:24:48.622 --> 00:24:50.157
He’s off!
He left the safe zone!

00:25:06.607 --> 00:25:09.042
[Tareq] Oh, he did it!
Holy crap!

00:25:09.109 --> 00:25:10.410
Oh, wait he’s on fire!

00:25:10.477 --> 00:25:11.645
Put him out!

00:25:12.045 --> 00:25:12.880
Put him out!

00:25:14.615 --> 00:25:15.916
Hey!
He's on fire!

00:25:15.983 --> 00:25:17.351
He's on fire!

00:25:17.417 --> 00:25:20.954
Eric has officially won $350,000!

00:25:21.021 --> 00:25:23.590
Another spectacular end
to an amazing stunt, dude!
